# ASL_SIGN_PREDICTOR
The first thing for any project is it's need...So let's start with that...Let's imagine that there are two person among which one i blind and the other is dumb...so how can they interact with each other?? One cannot speak and if he uses sign language,the other cannot see...so our aim is to provide a way of communication between them,it is not limited to this,it also helps in having the conversation with the one who doesn't understand sign language...So for this we have used Kaggle asl dataset and built a model using cnn to give voice to the sign language. 
This is a team project of three members namely Sourav Jain,Simardeep Singh and Parag Mittal.The link for the dataset used for this is "https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet"
# Context
The data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes.
# Content
The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING. These 3 classes are very helpful in real time applications, and classification. The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real world test images.
